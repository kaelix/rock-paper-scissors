# Summary

The first game I made using JavaScript. Making this project taught me so much about software development and how to problem solve when running into issues that I hadnt come across. While still challenging, 
the outcome is very rewarding. I look forward to making more projects and using the knowledge I gained from this game to further my skills and keep learning to make more complex applications.
As the first ever game I've made on my own I'm extremly happy with the outcome and am encouraged to continue my journey.
